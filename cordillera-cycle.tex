% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

  Despite more than a century of geological observations, the Cordilleran ice
  sheet of North America remains poorly understood in terms of its former
  extent, volume and dynamics. Although geomorphological evidence is abundant,
  its complexity is such that whole ice-sheet reconstructions of advance and
  retreat patterns are lacking. Here we use a numerical ice sheet model
  calibrated against field-based evidence to attempt a quantitative
  reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
  cycle. A series of simulations is driven by time-dependent temperature
  offsets from six proxy records located around the globe. Although this
  approach reveals large variations in model response to evolving atmospheric
  forcing, all simulations produce two major glaciation events during MIS~4
  (61.9--55.4\,\unit{kyr}) and MIS~2 (29.5--16.9\,\unit{kyr}). The timing of
  glaciation is
  better reproduced using temperature reconstructions from Greenland and
  Antarctic ice cores than from regional ocean sediment cores. During most of
  the last glacial cycle, the modelled ice cover is discontinuous and
  restricted to high mountain areas. However, widespread precipitation over the
  Skeena mountains favours the persistence of a central ice dome throughout the
  glacial cycle. It acts as a nucleation centre before the last glacial maximum
  and hosts the last remains of Cordilleran ice during the
  early Holocene (10.9--9.5\,\unit{kyr}).

\introduction
\label{sec:intro}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the last glacial cycle, glaciers and ice caps of the North American
Cordillera were more extensive than today. During the last glacial maximum, a
contiguous blanket of ice extended from Denali Peak in the north to the Puget
Sound in the south. This ice mass is known as the former Cordilleran ice
sheet (Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap}).

For more than a century, exploration and geological investigation of the
Cordillera have led to a large collection of evidence of the former ice cover. This
evidence consists of mapped boundaries of the former ice extent, directions of
past sliding velocities and locations of former melt-water streams, as well as
the timing of glacier retreat identified from radiocarbon and cosmogenic dating.

Field-based evidence allowed to reconstruct, with a high degree of confidence,
the maximal extent attained by the Cordilleran ice sheet during the last glacial
cycle. However, former ice thickness and the ice sheet's contribution to the
last glacial maximum sea-level low-stand remain poorly constrained. Moreover,
our understanding of the glaciation history is mainly restricted to the
deglaciation phase and on a regional scale, while little is known about the ice
sheet evolution prior to the last glacial maximum extent. Although
time-evolving, whole ice-sheet reconstructions of glacial advance and retreat
patterns are available for the Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheets, such is not
the case for the Cordilleran ice sheet, where complex arrangements of ice flow
directions emanating from multiple glaciation centres have been identified.

The present study uses a numerical ice sheet model (PISM) calibrated against
field-based evidence to perform a quantitative reconstruction of the
Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial cycle. Although
numerical modelling has been established as a useful tool to improve our
understanding
of the Cordilleran ice sheet more than twenty years ago \aref, the ubiquitously
mountainous topography of the region has presented a major challenge to its
application, which has only been overcome by recent development of numerical ice
sheet models and underlying scientific computing tools. In addition to the topographic
complexity, strong climatic contrasts characteristic of the North American
Cordillera require the use of a high-resolution temperature and precipitation
forcing as input data to the ice sheet model.

Because past climate conditions are subject to considerable uncertainty, our
palaeoclimate forcing is a simplistic approximation of time-evolved temperature
and precipitation fields derived from a combination of a present-day
atmospheric reanalysis (NARR), lapse-rate corrections and temperature offset
time series. The latter are
obtained by scaling six different palaeo-temperature reconstructions from
proxy records around the globe, including two \chem{\delta^{18}O} records from
Greenland ice cores, two \chem{\delta^{18}O} records from Antarctic ice cores,
and two alkenone unsaturation index records from Northwest Pacific oceanic
sediment cores. Model output is compared to geomorphological evidence in terms
of timing and extent of glaciation and patterns of deglaciation.

\section{Model setup}
\label{sec:model}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\note{Currently, this section contains parts from the previous paper.}

The simulations presented here were run using Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM,
development version~11b0a7f), an open-source, finite-difference, shallow ice
sheet model. The model takes basal topography, sea level, geothermal heat flux
and climate forcing, as input fields and computes the evolution of ice extent
and thickness in time, its thermal and dynamic state, and
the associated lithospheric response. Our modelling domain encompasses the
entire area covered by the Cordilleran ice sheet at the last glacial maximum
(Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap}).

To reconstruct the successive phases of growth and decay of the last Cordilleran
ice sheet, palaeo-climatic conditions of the last glacial cycle are mimicked
by applying time-dependent temperature offsets derived from multiple
palaeo-temperature proxy records. Each simulation starts from assumed ice-free
conditions at -120\,kyr, and runs to present. These computations were
performed on 16 to 128 cores at the Swedish National Supercomputing
Center.

\subsection{Ice thermodynamics}

PISM is a~shallow model, which implies that the balance of stresses is
approximated based on their predominant components.
The Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) is used as a ``sliding law'' for the
Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) \citep{bueler-brown-2009,winkelmann-etal-2011}.
SIA and SSA velocities are computed by finite difference methods on a~10\,km
resolution horizontal grid of 300 by 150 points (the modelling domain). Ice
softness depends on temperature and water content through an enthalpy
formulation \citep{aschwanden-blatter-2009,aschwanden-etal-2012}. Enthalpy is
computed in three dimensions in up to 51 layers within the
ice, and temperature is additionally computed in 31 layers in bedrock to
a~depth of 3\,km. Surface air temperature from the atmospheric forcing
provides the upper boundary condition to the ice enthalpy model, and
a~geothermal heat flux of 70\,\unit{mW\,m^{-2}} provides the lower boundary
condition to the bedrock thermal model. Although this uniform value does not
account for the high spatial geothermal variability in the region, it is on
average representative of available heat flow measurements
\citep{artemieva-mooney-2001,blackwell-richards-2004}.

A~pseudo-plastic sliding law \citep{aschwanden-etal-2013} relates the
bed-parallel shear stress and the sliding velocity. The yield stress is
modelled using the Mohr--Coulomb criterion. The till friction angle $\phi$
varies from 15 to 45{\degree}. It is taken as a~function of modern bed
elevation, with lowest values occurring at low elevation, thus accounting
for a~weakening of till associated with the presence of marine sediments
\citep{martin-etal-2011,aschwanden-etal-2013}. The till effective pressure is
related to the modelled amount of water in the till, using a formula derived
from laboratory experiments with till extracted from an Antarctic ice stream.
Basal topography is derived from the ETOPO1 combined topography
and bathymetry dataset with a~resolution of 1\,arc-min \citep{data:etopo1}.

\note{Do we need more details (equations) on this new sliding law?}

Sea level is lowered as a function of time according to the SPECMAP
reconstruction, and basal topography responds to ice load
following a bedrock deformation model that includes point-wise isostasy,
elastic lithosphere flexure and viscous mantle deformation in a~semi-infinite
half-space \citep{lingle-clark-1985,bueler-etal-2007}. It uses a lithosphere
density of 3300\,\unit{kg\,m^{-3}}, a flexural rigidity of $5 \times
10^{24}$\,\unit{N\,m} and a mantle viscosity of $1 \times
10^{21}$\,\unit{Pa\,s}. Due to the high mantle viscosity, there exists a time
lag between ice sheet growth and isostatic bedrock response.

\subsection{Surface mass-balance}

Ice surface accumulation and ablation are computed from monthly mean
near-surface air temperature, monthly precipitation, and monthly standard
deviation of near-surface temperature by a~temperature-index (positive
degree-day) model \citep{hock-2003}. Ice accumulation is equal to precipitation
when temperature is below 0\,\unit{{\degree}C}, and decreases to zero linearly
with temperature between 0 and 2\,\unit{{\degree}C}. Ice ablation is computed
from the number of positive degree-days, defined as the integral of
temperatures above 0\,\unit{{\degree}C} in one year.

The positive degree-day integral \citep{calov-greve-2005} is numerically
approximated using week-long sub-intervals. It accounts for temperature
variability assuming a~normal distribution along a~central (input) value. The
temperature standard deviation is part of the forcing climatology. It was
computed from daily temperature values from the North American Regional
Reanalysis \citep{data:narr}, excluding variability associated with the
seasonal cycle itself \citet{seguinot-rogozhina-2014}. The
ablation model incorporates degree-day factors of
3.04\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for snow and
4.59\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for ice, as derived from
mass-balance measurements on contemporary glaciers from the Coast Mountains and
Rocky Mountains in British Columbia \citep{shea-etal-2009}.

\subsection{Atmospheric forcing}

Atmospheric forcing of the model consists of a present-day monthly climatology
modified by a lapse-rate correction and time-dependent temperature offsets. The
present-day climatology was computed from the near-surface air temperature and
precipitation rate fields of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) over
the period 1979--2000 (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}). Modern climate of the North
American Cordillera is characterised by strong geographic variations of
seasonality, timing of the precipitation peak and daily temperature variability.
Our choice of data from the NARR is motivated by the need for an accurate,
high-resolution precipitation forcing, as outlined in a previous sensitivity
study.

Temperature offset time-series are derived from proxy records from
the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP), the North Greenland Ice Core Project
(NGRIP), the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA), the Lake
Vostok ice core, and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites 1012 and 1020, both
located off the Californian shore. Palaeo-temperatures from the GRIP and NGRIP
records were calculated using a quadratic equation \aref:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta T = -11.88(\chem{\delta^{18}O}-\chem{\delta^{18}O}_0)
               -0.1925(\chem{\delta^{18}O}^2-\chem{\delta^{18}O}_0^2)
\end{equation}
while the temperature reconstructions from the Antarctic and oceanic cores were
provided by their authors. All records were scaled linearly in
order to simulate comparable ice volumes and realistic ice extents at the last
glacial maximum (Table~\ref{tab:records}, Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}).

Prior to surface mass balance computation, the model dynamically applies
a~lapse-rate correction to surface air temperature. This correction accounts
for the evolution of ice thickness on the one hand, and differences between the
climate forcing reference topography and the ice flow model basal topography on
the other hand.
An annual lapse rate of 6\,\unit{{\degree}C\,km^{-1}} is used in all
simulations.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite large differences in the input temperature offset time-series, the
model output presents consistent features that can be observed across the range
of forcing data used. In all simulations, ice cover is relatively restricted
during most of the glacial cycle, while two major glaciation events occur
during MIS~4 (61.9--55.4\,\unit{kyr}) and MIS~2 (29.5--16.9\,\unit{kyr},
Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}). A local ice minimum is consistently attained in between these
two events during MIS~3 (52.2--45.6\,\unit{kyr}).

However, the magitude and timing of these events vary significantly
between our simulations. For instance, the use of GRIP and NGRIP forcing
results in highest variability in modelled ice volume. Simulations driven by
the Antarctic and GRIP records reach a last glacial maximum in ice volume at
19.5--16.9\,\unit{kyr}, while simulations driven by oceanic records
and the NGRIP record attain it prior to 20.0\,\unit{kyr}.

Despite the different timing,
snapshots of model output show relatively consistent patterns of glaciation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}). In all simulations, a central ice cap persists over
the Skeena mountains between the two glaciation events. However, the size of
this ice cap, as well as the magnitude of the MIS~4, depends sensitively on the temperature
offset time-series used to drive the model.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\note{At this stage, this section is just a collection of thoughts that need to
be developed into paragraphs. Please comment, criticize, add your own ideas.}

\subsection{Timing of glaciation}

Timing of glaciation is better reproduced by Greenland and Antarctic records than
nearby oceanic records. This is because the oceanic cores are affected by
variations in strength of a local current (the California current) associated
with the presence of the ice sheet. The timing of the LGM is better reproduced
by Antarctic than Greenland records.

\subsection{Extent of glaciation}

During most of the glacial cycle, ice cover is restricted to high mountain
areas. This is particularly true when using the Greenland-based forcing
(Fig~\ref{fig:duration}). Most of the glacial maxima margin has a transient
character, showing that the ice sheet is far out of balance with climate. There
persists a central ice dome over the Skeena mountains over the entire glacial
period. This ice dome serves as a nucleation centre at the initiation of the
advance phase preceding the last glacial maximum. It is here because of more
widespread precipitation over the Skeena mountains than across other East-West
transects towards south or north of this region. We interpret this as an
orographic precipitation effect resulting from a "window" through the sharp
range of the Coast Mountains at this latitude (Fig?).

\subsection{Deglaciation patterns}

Deglaciation happens first in the southern half and then in the northern half
of the ice-covered area (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}). Retreat patterns are different
than reconstructed over central BC, however they match Martin's reconstruction
of Liard lowland "unzipping" pretty well. In the GRIP-driven simulation, the
patterns of de-glaciation and Younger Dryas re-advance match with recent
cosmogenic exposure dates.
