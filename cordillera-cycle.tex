% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

  Despite more than a century of geological observations, the Cordilleran ice
  sheet of North America remains poorly understood in terms of its former
  extent, volume and dynamics. Although geomorphological evidence is abundant,
  its complexity is such that whole ice-sheet reconstructions of advance and
  retreat patterns are lacking. Here we use a numerical ice sheet model
  calibrated against field-based evidence to attempt a quantitative
  reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
  cycle. A series of simulations is driven by time-dependent temperature
  offsets from six proxy records located around the globe. Although this
  approach reveals large variations in model response to evolving atmospheric
  forcing, all simulations produce two major glaciation events during
  marine isotope stages~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and~2
  (29.5--16.9\,kyr). The timing of glaciation is
  better reproduced using temperature reconstructions from Greenland and
  Antarctic ice cores than from regional oceanic sediment cores. During most of
  the last glacial cycle, the modelled ice cover is discontinuous and
  restricted to high mountain areas. However, widespread precipitation over the
  Skeena Mountains favours the persistence of a central ice dome throughout the
  glacial cycle. It acts as a nucleation centre before the last glacial maximum
  and hosts the last remains of Cordilleran ice during the
  early Holocene (10.9--9.5\,kyr).

\introduction
\label{sec:intro}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the last glacial cycle, glaciers and ice caps of the North American
Cordillera have been more extensive than today. At the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), a continuous blanket of ice, the Cordilleran ice sheet\renote{
    In \citep{Seguinot.etal.2014}, The Cryosphere changed all my occurences of
    Cordilleran (Greenland etc) \textbf{I}ce \textbf{S}heet to lowercase
    \textbf{i}ce \textbf{s}heet. Let's keep it so for now for consistency
    within the thesis (kappa + papers).}
\citep{Dawson.1888}, extended from the Alaska Range in the north to the
North Cascades in the south. In addition, it extended offshore, where it calved
into the Pacific Ocean, and merged with the western margin of its much larger
neighbour, the Laurentide ice sheet, east of the Rocky Mountains
(Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap}).

More than a century of exploration and geological investigations of the
Cordilleran mountains have led to many observations in support of the former
ice sheet
    \citep{Jackson.Clague.1991}.
Despite the lack of documented end moraines offshore, in the zone of confluence
with the Laurentide ice sheet, and in areas swept by the Missoula floods
    \citep{Carrara.etal.1996},
moraines that demarcate the south-western and north-eastern margins provide key
constraints that allow reasonable reconstructions of maximum ice sheet extents
    (\citealp{Prest.etal.1968}; \citealp[Fig. 1.12]{Clague.1989};
     \citealp{Duk-Rodkin.1999};
     \citealp{Booth.etal.2003}; \citealp{Dyke.2004}).
The LGM Cordilleran ice sheet maximum extent was short-lived, as indicated by
field evidence from radiocarbon dating
    \citep{Clague.etal.1980, Clague.1985, Clague.1986, Porter.Swanson.1998,
           Menounos.etal.2008},
cosmogenic exposure dating
    \citep{Stroeven.etal.2010, Stroeven.etal.2014, Margold.etal.inpress},
bedrock deformation in response to former ice loads
    \citep{Clague.James.2002, Clague.etal.2005},
and offshore sedimentary records
    \citep{Cosma.etal.2008, Davies.etal.2011}.
However, former ice thicknesses and, therefore, the ice sheet's contribution to
the LGM sea level low stand
    \citep{Carlson.Clark.2012, Clark.Mix.2002}
remain uncertain.

Our understanding of the Cordilleran glaciation history prior to the LGM is
even more fragmentary
    \citep{Barendregt.Irving.1998, Kleman.etal.2010, Rutter.etal.2012},
although it is clear that maximum glaciation of the Cordilleran ice sheet
predates the last glacial cycle
    \citep{Hidy.etal.2013}.
In parts of the Yukon Territory and Alaska, the distribution of tills
    \citep{Turner.etal.2013}
and dated glacial erratics indicate an extensive Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage
(MIS)~4 glaciation
    \citep{Ward.etal.2007, Ward.etal.2008, Briner.Kaufman.2008,
           Stroeven.etal.2010, Stroeven.etal.2014},
yet it is not known whether other regions in the study area were affected.
Landforms in the interior regions include flow sets that are likely
older than the LGM
    \citep[Fig.~2]{Kleman.etal.2010},
but their absolute age remains uncertain.

In contrast, evidence for the deglaciation history of the Cordilleran
ice sheet since the LGM is considerable, albeit mostly at a regional scale.
Geomorphological evidence from south-central British Columbia indicates a rapid
deglaciation, including an early emergence of elevated areas while thin
stagnant ice still covered surrounding lowlands
    \citep{Fulton.1967, Fulton.1991, Margold.etal.2011, Margold.etal.2013a}.
This model, although credible, may not apply in all areas of the Cordilleran
ice sheet
    \citep{Margold.etal.2013}.
Although solid evidence for late-glacial glacier re-advances have been found in
the Coast, Columbia and Rocky mountains
    \citep{Clague.etal.1997, Friele.Clague.2002, Friele.Clague.2002a,
           Kovanen.2002, Kovanen.Easterbrook.2002, Lakeman.etal.2008,
           Menounos.etal.2008},
it appears to be more sparse than for formerly glaciated regions surrounding
the North Atlantic \aref, thus allowing for considerable uncertainty concerning
the possibility of a regional late glacial cold reversal.

In general, the topographic complexity of the North American Cordillera and its
effect on glacial history have inhibited the construction of ice sheet-wide
glacial advance and retreat patterns such as
those available for the Fennoscandian and Laurentide ice sheets
     \citep{Boulton.etal.2001, Dyke.Prest.1987, Dyke.etal.2003,
            Kleman.etal.1997, Kleman.etal.2010}.
Here, we use a numerical ice sheet model \citep{PISM-authors.2014},
calibrated against field-based evidence, to perform a quantitative
reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
cycle, and
analyse some of the long-standing questions related to its evolution:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How much ice was locked in the Cordilleran ice sheet during the
    last glacial maximum?
  \item What was the scale of glaciation prior to the last glacial maximum?
  \item Which were its primary dispersal centres? Do they reflect stable or
    ephemeral configurations?
  \item How rapid was the last deglaciation? Did it include late glacial
    stand-stills or re-advances?
\end{itemize}

Although numerical ice sheet modelling has been established as a useful tool to
improve our understanding of the Cordilleran ice sheet
    (\citealp[p.~227]{Jackson.Clague.1991}; \citealp{Robert.1991},
     \citealp{Marshall.etal.2000})
the ubiquitously mountainous
topography of the region has presented two major challenges to its application.
First, only recent development of numerical ice sheet models and underlying
scientific computing tools \citep{Bueler.Brown.2009, Balay.etal.2014} allows
high-resolution numerical modelling of palaeo-glaciers on mountainous terrain
over millenial time scales \citep[e.g.,][]{Golledge.etal.2012}. Second, the
complex
topography of the North American Cordillera also induces strong gradients in
seasonality and distinct patterns of precipition, thus requiring the use of
high-resolution atmospheric forcing fields as input to the ice sheet model
\citep{Seguinot.etal.2014}.

Because climate conditions over the last glacial cycle are subject to
considerable uncertainty, our palaeoclimate forcing is a simplistic approach
including temperature and precipitation fields derived from a
present-day atmospheric reanalysis \citep{Mesinger.etal.2006,
Seguinot.etal.2014} supplemented by a lapse-rate correction
and temperature offset time series. The latter are obtained by scaling six
different palaeo-temperature reconstructions from proxy records around the
globe, including two oxygen isotopes records from Greenland ice cores
\citep{Dansgaard.etal.1993, Andersen.etal.2004}, two oxygen isotopes
records from Antarctic ice cores \citep{Petit.etal.1999,Jouzel.etal.2007},
and two alkenone unsaturation index records from Northwest Pacific ocean
sediment cores \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}. Model output is compared to
geomorphological evidence in terms of the timing and extent of glaciation and
patterns of deglaciation.

%\subsection{Forcings}

\todo{Move parameter values into a separate table.}

\todo{Do we need a new subsection title here?}

The simulations presented here were run using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model
(PISM, development version~11b0a7f and stable version~0.6.1), an open source,
finite difference, shallow ice sheet model \citep{PISM-authors.2014}. The model
requires input on basal topography, sea level, geothermal heat flux and
atmospheric\renote{
    Changed here from ``climate'' to ``atmospheric''. Although I have used
    ``climate forcing'' in the previous paper, I now think that ``atmospheric
    forcing'' is more appropriate: ``climate'' may also encompass the oceanic
    component, not really assessed here.}
forcing, and computes the evolution of ice extent
and thickness over time, the thermal and dynamic\renote{
    Thermal = temperature, dynamic = force + movement. If I meant movement
    alone, I would use ``cinematic''. Here we could use ``ice temperatures,
    stress and deformation (i.e. velocities)'', but that becomes a bit clumsy,
    I feel.}
states of the ice sheet, and the associated lithospheric response.

Basal topography is derived from the ETOPO1 combined topography and bathymetry
dataset with a~resolution of 1\,arc-min \citep{Amante.Eakins.2009}. Sea level
is lowered as a function of time based on the Spectral Mapping Project\renote{
    I had no time to check for later products, but if you have suggestions for
    something more up-to-date, I can try to include it in later simulations
    (everything will have to be re-run anyway).}
\citep[SPECMAP;][]{Imbrie.etal.1989} time scale. Geothermal heat flux
is applied as a constant value of 70\,\unit{mW\,m^{-2}} at 3\,km depth
(Sect.~\ref{sec:icedyn}). Atmospheric forcing is provided by a monthly
climatology from the North American Regional Reanalysis
\citep[NARR;][]{Mesinger.etal.2006} perturbated by time-dependent and
lapse-rate temperature corrections (Sect.~\ref{sec:atm}).

Each simulation starts from assumed ice-free conditions at 120\,000 years ago
(120\,ka), and runs to present. Our modelling domain of 1\,500 by 3\,000\,km
encompasses the entire area covered by the Cordilleran ice sheet at the LGM
(Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap}). The simulations were run on two distinct grids, using
a lower horizontal resolution of 10\,km, and a higher horizontal resolution of
6\,km. These computations were performed on 16 to 128 computing cores at the
Swedish National Supercomputing Centre.

\subsection{Ice thermodynamics}
\label{sec:icedyn}

Ice sheet dynamics are typically modelled using a combination of internal
deformation and basal sliding. PISM is a~shallow ice sheet model, which implies
that the balance of stresses is approximated based on their predominant
components. The Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) is used as a ``sliding law''
for the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) by adding both velocity solutions
\citep[Eqns.~7--9 and 15]{Bueler.Brown.2009, Winkelmann.etal.2011}\renote{
    Arjen, I don't agree with your comment. Reference to equation number(s)
    show the reader where to look. \citet{Winkelmann.etal.2011} is a rather
    long paper that also treats many other aspects of the model. Their SIA+SSA
    approach builds on \citep{Bueler.Brown.2009}, but it is slightly different.
    It is the one in use in PISM, and in my simulations.}.
Ice rheology depends on temperature and water content through an enthalpy
formulation \citep{Aschwanden.etal.2012}. Surface air temperature derived from
the atmospheric forcing (Sect.~\ref{sec:atm}) provides the upper boundary
condition to the ice enthalpy model. Temperature is computed subglacially to
a~depth of 3\,km\renote{
    Yes, I changed this from 1 to 3\,km as we now model longer period of times
    than in the previous paper. The penetration depth of temperature anomalies
    (i.e. skin depth) depends on the period of temperature oscillations at the
    surface. The longer the period (in our case 100\,kyr), the deeper the
    temperature change. A good way to estimate what this parameter should be is
    to solve the 1-D temperature diffusion equation in the case of periodic
    surface forcing, using rock heat capacity and rock thermal conductivity
    values similar as in the numerical model. This basically forms the basis
    for my choice of the 3\,km value.},
where it is conditioned by a lower boundary geothermal heat flux of
70\,\unit{mW\,m^{-2}}. Although this uniform value does not account for the
high spatial geothermal variability in the region
\citep{Blackwell.Richards.2004}, it is, on average, representative of available
heat flow measurements. In the low-resolution simulations, the vertical grid
consists of to 51~enthalpy layers in the ice sheet and 31~temperature layers in
the bedrock. In the high-resolution simulations, up to 101~ice layers, and
61~bedrock layers are used.

A~pseudo-plastic sliding law \citep{Bueler.Pelt.2014} relates the
bed-parallel shear stress to the sliding velocity. The yield stress, $\tau_c$,
is modelled using the Mohr--Coulomb criterion,
\begin{equation}
   \tau_c = c_0 + N\,\tan{\phi} \,,
\end{equation}
where cohesion, $c_0$, is assumed to be zero. The friction angle, $\phi$,
varies from 15 to 45{\degree}\renote{
    Different from the previous paper, but fairly similar in effect (see
    $\alpha$ and $\delta$ parameter values and corresponding equations in the
    kappa, basal sliding section). These values are is based on a quick
    sensitivity test on Greenland.}.
It is taken to be a~function of modern bed elevation, with lower values at
lower elevations (<200\,m above sea level), thus accounting for a~weakening of
till associated with the presence of marine sediments. Effective pressure, $N$,
is related to the ice overburden stress, $\rho gh$, and the modelled amount of
subglacial water, using a formula derived from laboratory experiments with till
extracted from an Antarctic ice stream \citep{Tulaczyk.etal.2000,
Bueler.Pelt.2014},
\begin{equation}
    N = \delta \rho gh \, 10^{(e_0/C_c) (1 - (W/W_{max}))} \,,
\end{equation}
where $delta$ is choosed as 0.95, $e_0$ is a measured reference void ratio and
$C_c$ a measured compressibility coefficient. The amount of water at the base,
$W$, varies from zero to $W_{max}=2$\,m, a threshold above which instantaneous
drainage is assumed\renote{
    Regarding a parameter table, it is in the kappa, I am skipping it for now
    but will try to include it soon.}.
Finally, the bedrock topography responds to ice load\renote{
    I disagree with writing ``the isostatic response''. The main point in
    using this model is that computes a non-isostatic response.}
following a bedrock deformation model that includes point-wise isostasy,
elastic lithosphere flexure and viscous mantle deformation in the lower
half-space\renote{
    I had put an emphasis on semi-infinite at this is the key assumption of
    that model, allowing effective solution in Fourier domain. This is the
    whole point of Ed's paper and probably the reason why he picked it for PISM
    But yes, I guess that ``lower half-space'' is fine, too...}
\citep{Lingle.Clark.1985,Bueler.etal.2007}.

\subsection{Surface mass balance}

\renote{
    Surface mass balance is the balance of mass fluxes at the surface,
    consisting of ice accumulation and ice ablation, which I introduce straight
    away. I don't know what kind of ``opening sentence'' can be added here.}
Ice surface accumulation and ablation are computed from monthly mean
near-surface air temperature $T_m$, monthly standard deviation of near-surface
air temperature $\sigma$, and monthly precipitation $P_m$, using
a~temperature-index model \citep[e.g.,][]{Hock.2003}. Accumulation is equal to
precipitation when air temperatures are below 0\,\unit{{\degree}C}, and
decreases to zero linearly with temperatures between 0 and
2\,\unit{{\degree}C}. Ablation is computed from the number of positive
degree-days (PDD), defined as the integral of temperatures above
0\,\unit{{\degree}C} in one year.

The PDD computation accounts for stochastic temperature variations by assuming
a normal temperature distribution of standard deviation $\sigma$ aroung the
expected value $T_m$. It is expressed by an error-function formulation
\citep{Calov.Greve.2005},
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:calovgreve}
    \mathrm{PDD} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathrm{d}t
        \left[\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
                \exp\left({-\frac{T_{m}^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)
              + \frac{T_{m}}{2} \, \mathrm{erfc}
                \left(-\frac{T_{m}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)\right] \,,
\end{equation}
which is numerically approximated using week-long sub-intervals. In order to
account for the effects of spatial and seasonal variations of temperature
variability \citep{Seguinot.2013}, $\sigma$ is computed from daily temperature
values from the North American Regional Reanalysis
\citep[NARR,][]{Mesinger.etal.2006}, after excluding variability associated
with the seasonal cycle itself \citep[cf.][]{Seguinot.Rogozhina.2014}\renote{
    I may add a figure in the kappa if I find time, but I don't think that we
    should do it here. The subject is too marginal for the present study.}.
The ablation model incorporates degree-day factors of
3.04\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for snow and
4.59\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for ice, as derived from
mass-balance measurements on contemporary glaciers from the Coast Mountains and
Rocky Mountains in British Columbia \citep{Shea.etal.2009}.

\subsection{Atmospheric forcing}
\label{sec:atm}

Atmospheric forcing of the model consists of a present-day monthly climatology,
$\{T_{m0}, P_{m0}\}$, where temperatures are modified by offset time series,
${\Delta}T_{TS}$, and lapse-rate corrections, ${\Delta}T_{LR}$:
\begin{align}
    T_m(t, x, y) &= T_{m0}(x, y) + {\Delta}T_{TS}(t)
                    + {\Delta}T_{LR}(t, x, y) \,, \\
    P_m(t, x, y) &= P_{m0}(x, y) \,.
\end{align}

The present-day monthly climatology, $\{T_{m0}, P_{m0}\}$, was computed from
near-surface air temperature and precipitation rate fields of the NARR
\citep{Mesinger.etal.2006}, averaged between 1979 and 2000. Modern climate of the
North American Cordillera is characterised by strong geographic variations in
temperature seasonality, timing of the maximum annual precipitation, and
daily temperature variability (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}).
Our choice of data from the NARR is motivated by the need for an accurate,
high-resolution precipitation forcing, as identified in a previous sensitivity
study \citep{Seguinot.etal.2014}.

Temperature offset time-series, ${\Delta}T_{TS}$, are derived from
palaeo-temperature proxy records from
the Greenland Ice Core Project \citep[GRIP,][]{Dansgaard.etal.1993}, the
North Greenland Ice Core Project \citep[NGRIP,][]{Andersen.etal.2004},
the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica \citep[EPICA,][]
{Jouzel.etal.2007}, the Vostok ice core \citep{Petit.etal.1999}, and Ocean
Drilling Program (ODP) sites 1012 and 1020, both located off the Californian
coast \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}. Palaeo-temperatures from the GRIP and NGRIP
records were calculated from oxygen isotope (\chem{\delta^{18}O}) measurements
using a quadratic equation \citep{Johnsen.etal.1995},
\begin{equation}
    {\Delta}T_{TS}(t) = -11.88 [\chem{\delta^{18}O}(t)
                               -\chem{\delta^{18}O}(0)]
                        -0.1925[\chem{\delta^{18}O}(t)^2
                                -\chem{\delta^{18}O}(0)^2] \,,
\end{equation}
while temperature reconstructions from Antarctic and oceanic cores were
provided as such. All records were scaled linearly in
order to simulate realistic and comparable ice limits at the last
glacial maximum (Table~\ref{tab:records}, Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}).
In the rest of this paper, we occasionally refer to different model
runs by the name of the proxy record used for the palaeo-temperature forcing.

Finally, lapse-rate corrections, ${\Delta}T_{LR}$, are computed as a function
of ice surface elevation, $s$, using the NARR surface geopotential height
invariant field as a reference topography, $b_{ref}$, by
\begin{align}
    {\Delta}T_{LR}(t, x, y) &= -\gamma [s(t, x, y)-b_{ref}] \\
                            &= -\gamma [h(t, x, y)+b(t, x, y)-b_{ref}],
\end{align}

thus accounting for the evolution of ice thickness, ${h=s-b}$\renote{
    Small change in notation to match with the kappa},
on the one hand, and
for differences between the the ice flow model basal topography, $b$, and the
NARR reference topography, $b_{ref}$, on the other hand. All simulations use an
annual temperature lapse rate of $\gamma = 6\,\unit{{\degree}C\,km^{-1}}$.

\section{Model sensitivity to atmospheric forcing}
\label{sec:results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite large differences in the input atmospheric forcing (temperature offset
time-series; Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}), model output presents consistent
features that can be observed across the range of forcing data used. In all
simulations, modelled ice volumes remain relatively low during most of the
glacial cycle, except during two major glacial events which occur between 61.9
and 55.4\,ka during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS)~4, and between 29.5 and
16.9\,ka during MIS~2 (Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}). An ice volume minimum is
consistently attained between 52.2 and 45.6\,ka during MIS~3. However, the
magnitude and precise timing of these three events depend significantly on the
choice of proxy record used for time-dependent atmospheric forcing
(Table~\ref{tab:records})\renote{
    Hopefully this new table will assess several of your comments at once.}.

Simulations forced by the Greenland ice core palaeo-temperature\renote{
    Throughout this section, I prepended ``palaeo-temperature'' to
    ``record(s)'' in place of ``climate'' as you originally suggested. If we
    are to precise what type ``records'' we use, let's be clear about it.}
records (GRIP, NGRIP) produce the highest variability in modelled ice volume
throughout the last glacial cycle. In contrast, simulations driven by oceanic
(ODP~1012, ODP~1020) and Antarctic (EPICA, Vostok) palaeo-temperature records
generally result in smaller\renote{
    Until we run out of other ajectives, I don't think that ``modest'' and
    ``generous'' are adequate terms for describing ice volumes.}
modelled ice volumes during MIS~4 and larger ice volumes during MIS~3.
More broadly speaking, they produce lower ice volume variability
throughout the simulation length. The NGRIP atmospheric forcing is the only one
that results in a larger ice volume during MIS~4 than during the last glacial
maximum (MIS~2).

While simulations driven by GRIP and the two Antarctic palaeo-temperature
records attain a last ice volume maximum between 19.5 and 16.9\,ka, those
informed by NGRIP and the two oceanic palaeo-temperature records attain their
maximum ice volume thousands of years earlier. Moreover, the ODP~1012 run
yields a rapid deglaciation of the modelled area prior to 20\,ka. The ODP~1020
simulation predicts an early maximum in ice volume at 29.5\,ka, followed by
slower deglaciation than modelled using other palaeo-temperature records.
Finally, model runs forced by Antarctic palaeo-temperature records produce a
rapid an uninterrupted deglaciation after the last glacial maximum, whereas the
simulation driven by the GRIP palaeo-temperature record also yields a rapid
deglaciation but in three steps, interrupted by two stand-stills and readvances
of the ice margin.

Despite such differences in the timing of attained volume maxima and mimima,
snapshots of model output show relatively consistent patterns of glaciation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}). As a result of scaling factors applied to the
different palaeo-temperature proxy records (Table~\ref{tab:records}), modelled
ice sheet geometries during the last glacial maximum (MIS~2;
Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}, lower panels) appear highly similar from one
simulation to the next. They include a ca. 1\,500\,km-long central divide
located about 3\,500\,m\ above sea level (a.s.l.) along the spine of the Rocky
Mountains. The volumes of these modelled last glacial maximum ice sheets are
contained within a close range from 8.24 to 8.66\,m of sea-level equivalent
(s.l.e; Table~\ref{tab:records}).
A central ice cap persists in all simulations over the Skeena
Mountains during the MIS~3 ice volume minima (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}, middle
panels). However, the size of the Skeena Mountains ice cap, and the dimensions
of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the MIS~4 glaciation, depend sensitively on
the choice of palaeo-temperature record used to drive the model.

\subsection{Scale and timing of glaciation}

Independently of the choice of palaeo-temperature record used as forcing
time-series for the ice sheet model, our simulations consistently produce two
glaciation maxima during MIS~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and MIS~2
(29.5--16.9\,kyr). These events broadly correspond in timing to the
Gladstone (MIS~4) and McConell (MIS~2) glaciations documented by geological
evidence in the northern part of the model domain \aref, and to the Fraser
(MIS~2) glaciation in the southern part \aref
\footnote{\textbf{Arjen, Martin, Johan,} can you check that I use these names
    correctly, and help me to fill the missing refs in this sentence? Is is
    possible to trace back when these names where first applied?}.

However, the timing of the modelled glacial maxima strongly depends on the
choice of palaeo-temperature record used, and a more precise agreement with
timing reconstructed from geological evidence is only attained in some of our
simulations. In the Puget lowland, the last glacial maximum advance of the
southern Cordilleran ice sheet margin has been constrained by radiocarbon
dating between 17.4 and 16.4\,\unit{\chem{^{14}C}\,cal\,kyr\,BP}
\citep[Fig.~4]{Porter.Swanson.1998}.
These dates have been confirmed by the offshore sediment record, which shows an
increase of glaciomarine sedimentation between 19.5 and
16.2\,\unit{\chem{^{14}C}\,cal\,kyr\,BP} \citep{Cosma.etal.2008}.

Among simulations presented here, only those forced by the GRIP, EPICA and
Vostok records place the last glacial maximum within this range
(Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}, lower panel). Simulations driven by the NGRIP,
ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 records, on the contrary, produce a last glacial maximum
that pre-dates reconstructed ages by several thousand years. Concerning the
simulations driven by oceanic records, this early deglaciation is caused by an
early warming sealed in the palaeo-temperature reconstructions
(Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}, upper panel). However, it has been shown that this
early warming is a local effect, corresponding to a weakening of the California
current \citep[Fig.~3]{Herbert.etal.2001}. The California current, driving cold
waters southwards
along the western coast of North America, is thought to have weakened in the
presence of the Cordilleran ice sheet, resulting in paradoxically warmer
sea-surface temperatures at the locations of the ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 sites
during the last glacial maximum \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}.

Because most of the Cordilleran ice sheet marine front lies in a different
oceanic circulation gyre than that holding the California current, it is
unlikely that it was affected by this early warming. However, the above paradox
illustrates the complexity of ice-sheet feedbacks on regional climate, and
demonstrates that, although located in the neighbourhood of the modelling
domain, the ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 palaeo-temperature proxy records can not be
used as a realistic forcing time-series to model the Cordilleran ice sheet
through the last glacial cycle.

These results make us believe that a palaeo-temperature proxy record located
in the direct vicinity of the former Cordilleran ice sheet would be of great
help to further understand its glacial history. Because, to our knowledge, no
such record yet exists, we focus the rest of our analysis on simulations forced
by temperature records from Greenland (GRIP) and Antarctic (EPICA) ice cores
(Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}, lower panel, dotted lines).

\subsection{Location and longevity of the major ice-despersal centres}

\todo{Add some point, refer back to Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}.}

Although snapshots from the model output (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}) give a
crisp picture of modelled ice dynamics at specific time frames, they often
can not be directly compared to geomorphological evidence, which is by nature
time-transgressive. In this section, we use the 6-km horizontal-resolution
model output from simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA records to produce
a series of time-integrated plots containing information aggregated over the
whole simulation period.

During most of the glacial cycle, modelled ice cover is restricted to disjoint
ice caps centred on major mountain ranges of the North American Cordillera
(Fig.~\ref{fig:duration}). In both simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA
records, a~contiguous ice cover spanning from the Alaska Range to the Rocky
Mountains exists for about 29\,kyr in total over MIS~2 and~4.
With the exception of the oceanic front and the northern foothills of the Alaska
Range, most of the maximal extent of the ice sheet is associated with short
durations of ice cover, generally a few thousand years, distributed over one
(GRIP) or two (EPICA) glaciations (Fig.~\ref{fig:duration}). This illustrates
that the most extensive stages of the modelled ice sheet are both short-lived
and out of balance with contemporary climate states, which confirms previous
inferences of a short-lived Cordilleran ice sheet based on the geological
record \citep{Clague.etal.1980, Stroeven.etal.2010}.

However, our simulations depict, independently of the choice of record used for
palaeo-temperature forcing, a central Skeena mountain ice cap persisting
throughout the entire last glacial cycle (Figs.~\ref{fig:snapshots}
and~\ref{fig:duration}). In particular, this ice cap persists during MIS~3,
providing a nucleation centre for the onset of glacial
readvance towards the last glacial maximum (MIS~2).

During time periods when a fully-grown Cordilleran ice sheet is absent from our
simulation, the presence of the Skeena ice cap can be explained by a more
widespread winter precipitation there than in other parts of the modelling
domain (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}). Along most of the north-western North American
shore, coastal mountain ranges provide a sharp orographic barrier to westerly
winds, capturing atmospheric moisture in the form of precipitation, and leaving
interior lowlands arid. However, near the centre of our modelling domain, this
barrier is less pronounced than
elsewhere, allowing westerly winds to carry moisture further inland, until it
is progressively captured by the broad and mildly elevated group of the Skeena
Mountains.

In addition, the erosional landscape of the Skeena mountain bears one of the
strongest glacial imprint found within the area formerly covered by the
Cordilleran ice sheet \aref%
\footnote{\textbf{Arjen, Martin, Johan,} can we use a reference here to support
    this point (observations, mapping, shaded relief)? Alternatively, we could
    maybe use a photograph, if any of you has one. It would add a bit of
    variation into the figure list. \textbf{Johan}, you seemed to support this
    this point during our discussion, any idea?}.
Here we suggest that persistent ice cover (Fig.~\ref{fig:duration})
associated with basal ice temperatures at the pressure-melting point
(Fig.~\ref{fig:warmfrac} and ~\ref{fig:warmbase}%
\footnote{Fig.~\ref{fig:erosion} is tricky because it may be significantly
    affected by the constant-geothermal heat flux assumption, which is not
    valid for this region. Arjen, Johan and I decided to leave it for my kappa
    for now. Regarding Figs.~\ref{fig:warmfrac} and ~\ref{fig:warmbase}, I
    still wonder if it is useful to show both. Basically we have
    Fig.~\ref{fig:warmbase}\,=\,Fig.~\ref{fig:duration}\,*\,Fig.~\ref{fig:warmfrac}.
    Maybe the reader can perform this multiplication visually without need of
    Fig.~\ref{fig:warmbase}? Tell me what you think of it.})
may partly explain this spectacular landscape.

\subsection{Pace and patterns of deglaciation}

In the North American Cordillera alike other glaciated regions, the large
majority of the glacial geologic record relates to the last few millennia of
glacier cover, most of the older evidence having been overridden by ice retreat
retreat during the deglaciation\footnote{\textbf{Johan,} can we refer to one
of your papers here?}.

In our simulations, the timing of the last glacial maximum, and in turn that of
the deglaciation, depends on the palaeo-temperature time-series used to force
the model (Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}). The
6\,km-resolution simulation forced by the EPICA record reaches a maximal
ice volume at 17.3\,kyr, followed by a continuous deglaciation between
about 17 and 11\,kyr (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglacseries}, red dotted curve).
That driven by the GRIP record reaches maximal
volume at 19.1\,kyr, and produces a deglaciation in three steps,
including the first stand-still between 16.6 and 14.5\,kyr, and a late
glacial re-advance between 12.6 and 11.6\,kyr (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglacseries},
blue dotted curve).

The possibly of a widespread late-glacial in
the North American Cordilleran has been debated for long. On the southern tip
of the Coast Mountains, radiocarbon-dated frontal moraines indicate multiple
stages of glacial re-advance in the Fraser and Squamish valleys, of which
one corresponds to the Younger Dryas chronozone \citep{Clague.etal.1997,
Friele.Clague.2002, Friele.Clague.2002a, Kovanen.2002,
Kovanen.Easterbrook.2002}. In the Finlay River area, northern Rocky Mountains,
sharp-crested moraines show an abundant remobilization of late-glacial
sediments by alpine glaciers in interaction with the main body of the decaying
ice sheet \citep{Lakeman.etal.2008}. Additional clues for a late-glacial
re-advance include alpine glacier moraines in the eastern Coast Mountains,
Rocky Mountains and Columbia Mountains \citep{Menounos.etal.2008}. Although
further work is needed to constrain the timing of the late-glacial re-advance,
to seize its extent and to identify potential climatic triggers
\citep{Menounos.etal.2008}, it is interesting to note that the simulation
driven by the GRIP record produces a late-glacial re-advance in the Coast
Mountains, Rocky Mountains and Finlay River area, corresponding to where it
has been identified in the geologic record (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}, left panel),
whereas the EPICA-driven simulation produces a nearly-continuous deglaciation
with very restrained glacial re-advance (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}, right panel)%
\footnote{Should we mention our work in progress with Brian and/or the Tuya
    Lake moraine?}.

Although the predicted timing of glacier retreat differs between the two
simulations, its patterns are relatively consistent (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}). In
both runs, the southern half of the modelling domain, including the Puget
Lowland, the Coast and Rocky Mountains and the Interior Plateau of British
Columbia, are completely deglaciated by 12\,kyr, whereas significant ice cover
remains on the Skeena, Selwyn, MacKenzie, Wrangell and Saint-Elias Mountains
in the northern half of the domain. After 12\,kyr, deglaciation proceeds
through an opening of the Liard lowland with radial margin retreat towards the
surrounding mountain ranges and inward flow towards the depression, in
compatibility with the regional melt water record \citep{Margold.etal.2013}.
Remaining ice continues its decay by retreating towards the Selwyn Mountains
and, then, the Skeena Mountains. The last remains of the palaeo-ice sheet
vanish in the Skeena Mountains at around 10.6\,kyr in the EPICA simulation
versus 9.4\,kyr in the GRIP simulation.

Once more, snapshots of modelled deglacial ice sheet configurations
(Figs.~\ref{fig:deglacshots-grip} and~\ref{fig:deglacshots-epica}%
\footnote{I produced one figure for each run, but as you could expect from
    Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}, Figs.~\ref{fig:deglacshots-grip}
    and~\ref{fig:deglacshots-epica} look very similar. One of them would
    probably be enough, or?}) provide a
poor medium for direct comparison with geomorphological evidence of the ice
retreat. Here, we compute a map of deglacial, basal flow directions immediately
preceding exposure of ice-free land or cessation of sliding upon the approach
of the retreating margin (Fig.~\ref{fig:lastflow}). On the northern and
southern front of the ice sheet and in the Liard Lowland, the resulting map
show similarities with patterns of glacial lineations
(\citealp{Prest.etal.1968}; \citealp[Fig.~1.12]{Clague.1989};
\citealp[Fig.~2]{Kleman.etal.2010}; \citealp[Fig.~2]{Margold.etal.2013}).
However, such is not the case on the Interior Plateau of British Columbia,
where both simulations predicts negligible basal sliding during deglaciation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:lastflow}), whereas glacial lineation maps indicate substantial
eastward flow.

On the one hand, this could indicate that the model performs poorly in this
region, perhaps because the modelled last glacial maximum ice sheet is too
thick, or too extensive to the west. Because feedback mechanisms between ice
sheet topography and regional climate such as wind redistribution, orographic
precipitation and latent warming of moisture-depleted air are absent in our
model, we regard this possibility as fully probable \citep{Seguinot.etal.2014}.
On the other hand, in both simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA records,
the deglaciation of central British Columbia consists of a rapid northwards
retreat associated with southwards-flowing, non-sliding ice lobes on the
Interior Plateau, while the surrounding mountain ranges are already ice-free
(Figs.~\ref{fig:profiles-grip} and~\ref{fig:profiles-epica}). This result
appears compatible with the prevailing conceptual model of deglaciation of
central British Columbia, in which mountain ranges emerge from the ice before
the plateau \citep[Fig.~7]{Fulton.1991}. If it is valid, it may suggest that
glacial lineations on the Interior Plateau of British Columbia may be of older
age than the last glacial maximum, and may have remained intact throughout the
deglaciation.

\conclusions
\label{sec:concl}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Numerical simulations of the Cordilleran ice sheet through the last glacial
cycle presented in this study consistently produce two glaciation maxima during
MIS~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and MIS~2 (29.5--16.9\,kyr), two periods
corresponding to documented extensive glaciations. This result is
independent of the choice of palaeo-temperature record used to approximate past
climate evolution, and thus
can be seen as a first-order agreement between the model and geological
evidence. However, the timing of the two glaciation peaks depends sensitively
on which record
is used to drive the model. The timing of the last glacial maximum is best
reproduced by the Antarctic record, and occurs too early in all simulations
that are driven by other records. The mismatch is greatest when using
oceanic records from the Pacific Northwest, which are affected by the
weakening of the California current during the last glacial maximum.

In all simulations presented here, ice cover is limited to disjoint mountain ice
caps during most of the glacial cycle, confirming previous inferences from
geological evidence preceding the last glacial maximum. However, our
simulations produce persistent ice cover on the Skeena mountains during
the entire glacial cycle. At the time when a full-size Cordilleran ice sheet is
absent, the Skeena ice cap appears to be fed by the eastwards precipitation
intrusion through a topographic window in the Coast Mountains. The ice cap acts
as a nucleation centre at the onset of the last glacial maximum re-advance, and
may have contributed to the spectacular glacial imprint of the Skeena Mountains
erosional landscape.

During deglaciation, none of the palaeo-temperature records used produces an
ideal agreement between model results and geological evidence. Although
the EPICA record yields to more realistic timing of the last glacial maximum
and early deglaciation, only the GRIP record produces a late-glacial re-advance
at places where it has been documented in the literature. Nonetheless, the
general patterns of deglaciation are consistent between both simulations driven
by the GRIP and EPICA record, and show a rapid deglaciation of the southern
half of the ice including rapid northwards retreat through the Interior
Plateau of central British Comumbia, followed by an opening of the Liard
Lowland, and final ice cap retreat of the ice margin towards the Selwyn and,
then, the Skeena Mountains, which host the last remnant of the ice sheet
during the early Holocene (10.9--9.5\,kyr).

These results strongly depend on our choices of ice-sheet model (PISM), surface
mass balance model (PDD) and climate forcing. Most importantly, our simplistic
palaeo-climate forcing does not include precipitation corrections in response
to the presence of an ice cover, potentially leading to overestimated glacial
extent and volume in continental regions. Nevertheless, our results identify
the glacially-scrubbed Skeena Mountains as a central, key area to understanding
glacial dynamics of the Cordilleran ice sheet, highlighting the need for
further geological investigation of this region.

           Note the irregular colour scale. A contiguous ice cover spanning
           from the Alaska Range (AR) to the southern Coast Mountains (CM) and
           Rocky Mountains (RM) exists for about 29\,kyr in both
           simulations. A central
           ice cover persists over the Skeena Mountains (SM) during most of the
           simulation. On the other hand, the maximal extent of the ice sheet
           generally corresponds to relatively short durations of ice cover.}
