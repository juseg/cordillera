% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

  Despite more than a century of geological observations, the Cordilleran ice
  sheet of North America remains poorly understood in terms of its former
  extent, volume and dynamics. Although geomorphological evidence is abundant,
  its complexity is such that whole ice-sheet reconstructions of advance and
  retreat patterns are lacking. Here we use a numerical ice sheet model
  calibrated against field-based evidence to attempt a quantitative
  reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
  cycle. A series of simulations is driven by time-dependent temperature
  offsets from six proxy records located around the globe. Although this
  approach reveals large variations in model response to evolving atmospheric
  forcing, all simulations produce two major glaciation events during
  marine isotope stages~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and~2
  (29.5--16.9\,kyr). The timing of glaciation is
  better reproduced using temperature reconstructions from Greenland and
  Antarctic ice cores than from regional ocean sediment cores. During most of
  the last glacial cycle, the modelled ice cover is discontinuous and
  restricted to high mountain areas. However, widespread precipitation over the
  Skeena mountains favours the persistence of a central ice dome throughout the
  glacial cycle. It acts as a nucleation centre before the last glacial maximum
  and hosts the last remains of Cordilleran ice during the
  early Holocene (10.9--9.5\,kyr).

\introduction
\label{sec:intro}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the last glacial cycle, glaciers and ice caps of the North American
Cordillera were more extensive than today. At the last glacial maximum, a
contiguous blanket of ice extended from the Alaska Range in the north to the
North Cascades in the south \citep[Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap};][Plate XIV]
{Chamberlin.1894}. This ice mass is known as the former Cordilleran ice sheet
\citep{Dawson.1888}.

For more than a century, exploration and geological investigation of the
Cordillera have led to a large collection of evidence of the former ice cover
\citep{Jackson.Clague.1991}. This evidence consists of mapped boundaries of the
former ice extent (\citealp[Fig.~1.12]{Clague.1989}; \citealp{Duk-Rodkin.1999};
\citealp{Dyke.2004}), directions of past sliding velocities
(\citealp{Prest.etal.1968}; \citealp[Fig.~2]{Kleman.etal.2010}), and locations
of former
melt-water streams \citep{Margold.etal.2011, Margold.etal.2013}, as well as the
timing of glaciation identified from radiocarbon dating \citep[e.g.,][]
{Clague.1981, Porter.Swanson.1998}, cosmogenic dating \citep[e.g.,][]
{Ward.etal.2007, Menounos.etal.2009, Stroeven.etal.2010, Stroeven.etal.2013},
and the offshore sedimental record \citep{Cosma.etal.2008, Davies.etal.2011}.

Field-based evidence allowed to reconstruct, with a high degree of confidence,
the maximal extent attained by the Cordilleran ice sheet during the last
glacial cycle (\citealp[Fig. 1.12]{Clague.1989}; \citealp{Dyke.2004}). However,
former ice thickness
and the ice sheet's contribution to the last glacial maximum sea-level
low-stand remain poorly constrained. Moreover, our understanding of the
glaciation history is mainly restricted to the deglaciation phase and a
regional scale, while little is known about the ice sheet evolution prior to
the last glacial maximum extent \citep[Fig.~6]{Kleman.etal.2010}. Although
time-evolving, whole ice-sheet reconstructions of glacial advance and retreat
patterns are available for the Eurasian and Laurentide and ice sheets
\citep{Kleman.etal.1997, Kleman.etal.2010}, such is not the case for the
Cordilleran ice sheet, where complex arrangements of ice flow directions
emanating from multiple glaciation centres have been identified
\citep[Fig.~1.12]{Prest.etal.1968, Clague.1989}, but remain poorly understood
\citep[p.~2049]{Kleman.etal.2010}.

The present study uses a numerical ice sheet model \citep{PISM-authors.2014},
calibrated against field-based evidence to perform a quantitative
reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
cycle. Although numerical modelling has been established as a useful tool to
improve our understanding of the Cordilleran ice sheet more than twenty years
ago (\citealp[p.~227]{Jackson.Clague.1991}; \citealp{Robert.1991}), the
ubiquitously mountainous
topography of the region has presented a major challenge to its application.
In fact, only recent development of numerical ice sheet models and underlying
scientific computing tools \citep[e.g.,][]{Bueler.Brown.2009} allows
high-resolution numerical modelling of palaeo-glacier flow on mountainous
terrain over millenial time scales \citep[e.g.,][]{Golledge.etal.2012}. In the
North
American Cordillera, the topographic complexity induces strong gradients in
seasonality and distinct patterns of precipition, thus requiring the use of
high-resolution atmospheric forcing fields as input to the ice sheet model
\citep{Seguinot.etal.2013}.

Because past climate conditions are subject to considerable uncertainty, our
palaeoclimate forcing is a simplistic approximation of time-evolved temperature
and precipitation fields derived from a combination of a present-day
atmospheric reanalysis \citep{Mesinger.etal.2006}, lapse-rate corrections,
and temperature offset time series. The latter are obtained by scaling six
different palaeo-temperature reconstructions from proxy records around the
globe, including two \chem{\delta^{18}O} records from Greenland ice cores
\citep{Dansgaard.etal.1993, Andersen.etal.2004}, two \chem{\delta^{18}O}
records from Antarctic ice cores \citep{Petit.etal.1999,Jouzel.etal.2007},
and two alkenone unsaturation index records from Northwest Pacific oceanic
sediment cores \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}. Model output is compared to
geomorphological evidence in terms of timing and extent of glaciation and
patterns of deglaciation.

\section{Model setup}
\label{sec:model}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The simulations presented here were run using Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM,
development version~11b0a7f), an open-source, finite-difference, shallow ice
sheet model \citep{PISM-authors.2014}. The model inputs basal topography,
sea level, geothermal
heat flux and climate forcing, and computes the evolution of ice extent
and thickness in time, the thermal and dynamic state of the ice sheet, and
the associated lithospheric response. Our modelling domain encompasses the
entire area covered by the Cordilleran ice sheet at the last glacial maximum
(Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap}).

To reconstruct the successive phases of growth and decay of the last Cordilleran
ice sheet, palaeo-climatic conditions of the last glacial cycle are mimicked
by applying time-dependent temperature offsets derived from multiple
palaeo-temperature proxy records. Each simulation starts from assumed ice-free
conditions at -120\,kyr, and runs to present. These computations were
performed on 16 to 128 cores at the Swedish National Supercomputing
Center.

\subsection{Ice thermodynamics}

PISM is a~shallow model, which implies that the balance of stresses is
approximated based on their predominant components.
The Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) is used as a ``sliding law'' for the
Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) \citep[Eqn.~15]{Winkelmann.etal.2011}.
Ice softness depends on temperature and water content through an enthalpy
formulation \citep{Aschwanden.etal.2012}. Surface air
temperature from the atmospheric forcing provides the upper boundary condition
to the ice enthalpy model. Temperature is computed subglacially to a~depth of
3\,km, where it is conditioned by a~geothermal heat flux of
70\,\unit{mW\,m^{-2}}. Although this uniform value does not
account for the high spatial geothermal variability in the region, it is on
average representative of available heat flow measurements
\citep{Blackwell.Richards.2004}.

A~pseudo-plastic sliding law \citep{PISM-authors.2014} relates the
bed-parallel shear stress and the sliding velocity. The yield stress is
modelled using the Mohr--Coulomb criterion. The till friction angle $\phi$
varies from 15 to 45{\degree}. It is taken as a~function of modern bed
elevation, with lowest values occurring at low elevation, thus accounting
for a~weakening of till associated with the presence of marine sediments.
The till effective pressure is related to the modelled amount of water in the
till, using a formula derived from laboratory experiments with till extracted
from an Antarctic ice stream \citep[Eqn.~2]{Tulaczyk.etal.2000}. Basal
topography is
derived from the ETOPO1 combined topography and bathymetry dataset with
a~resolution of 1\,arc-min \citep{Amante.Eakins.2009}.
Sea level is lowered as a function of time according to the SPECMAP
reconstruction, and basal topography responds to ice load
following a bedrock deformation model that includes point-wise isostasy,
elastic lithosphere flexure and viscous mantle deformation in a~semi-infinite
half-space \citep{Lingle.Clark.1985,Bueler.etal.2007}.

\subsection{Surface mass-balance}

Ice surface accumulation and ablation are computed from monthly mean
near-surface air temperature, monthly precipitation, and monthly standard
deviation of near-surface temperature by a~temperature-index (positive
degree-day) model \citep[e.g.,]{Hock.2003}. Ice accumulation is equal to
precipitation
when temperature is below 0\,\unit{{\degree}C}, and decreases to zero linearly
with temperature between 0 and 2\,\unit{{\degree}C}. Ice ablation is computed
from the number of positive degree-days, defined as the integral of
temperatures above 0\,\unit{{\degree}C} in one year.

The positive degree-day integral \citep[Eqn.~6]{Calov.Greve.2005} is
numerically
approximated using week-long sub-intervals. It accounts for temperature
variability assuming a~normal distribution along a~central (input) value. The
temperature standard deviation is part of the forcing climatology. It was
computed from daily temperature values from the North American Regional
Reanalysis \citep[NARR,][]{Mesinger.etal.2006}, after excluding variability
associated with the seasonal cycle itself \citep[cf.][]
{Seguinot.Rogozhina.2014}. The
ablation model incorporates degree-day factors of
3.04\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for snow and
4.59\,\unit{mm\,{\degree}C^{-1}\,day^{-1}} for ice, as derived from
mass-balance measurements on contemporary glaciers from the Coast Mountains and
Rocky Mountains in British Columbia \citep{Shea.etal.2009}.

\subsection{Atmospheric forcing}

Atmospheric forcing of the model consists of a present-day monthly climatology
$\{T_{m0}, P_{m0}\}$, modified by a lapse-rate correction ${\Delta}T_{LR}$ and
temperature-offset time series ${\Delta}T_{TS}$.
\begin{align}
    T_m(t, x, y) &= T_{m0}(x, y) + {\Delta}T_{LR}(t) + {\Delta}T_{TS}(t, x, y) \\
    P_m(t, x, y) &= P_{m0}(x, y)
\end{align}

The present-day climatology $\{T_{m0}, P_{m0}\}$ was computed from
near-surface air temperature and precipitation rate fields of the NARR
\citep{Mesinger.etal.2006} over
the period 1979--2000 (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}). Modern climate of the North
American Cordillera is characterised by strong geographic variations of
seasonality, timing of the precipitation peak and daily temperature variability.
Our choice of data from the NARR is motivated by the need for an accurate,
high-resolution precipitation forcing, as outlined in a previous sensitivity
study \citep{Seguinot.etal.2013}.

The lapse-rate correction ${\Delta}T_{LR}$ is computed using the NARR surface
geopotential height a reference topography $z_{ref}$,
\begin{align}
    {\Delta}T_{LR}(t, x, y) &= -\gamma [z_{s}(t, x, y)-z_{ref}] \\
                            &= -\gamma [h(t, x, y)+z_{b}(t, x, y)-z_{ref}],
\end{align}

thus accounting for the evolution of ice thickness $h$ on the one hand, and
for differences between the the ice flow model basal topography $z_{b}$ and the
NARR topography $z_{ref}$ on the other hand. All simulations use an annual temperature lapse rate of $\gamma = 6\,\unit{{\degree}C\,km^{-1}}$.

Temperature offset time-series ${\Delta}T_{TS}$ are derived from proxy records from
the Greenland Ice Core Project \citep[GRIP,][]{Dansgaard.etal.1993}, the
North Greenland Ice Core Project \citep[NGRIP,][]{Andersen.etal.2004},
the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica \citep[EPICA,][]
{Jouzel.etal.2007}, the Lake Vostok ice core \citep{Petit.etal.1999}, and Ocean
Drilling Program (ODP) sites 1012 and 1020, both located off the Californian
shore \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}. Palaeo-temperatures from the GRIP and NGRIP
records were calculated using a quadratic equation \citep{Johnsen.etal.1995},
\begin{equation}
    {\Delta}T_{TS}(t) = -11.88[\chem{\delta^{18}O(t)}-\chem{\delta^{18}O}(0)]
                        -0.1925[\chem{\delta^{18}O(t)}^2-\chem{\delta^{18}O}(0)^2],
\end{equation}
while the temperature reconstructions from the Antarctic and oceanic cores were
provided as such. All records were scaled linearly in
order to simulate realistic and comparable ice extents at the last
glacial maximum (Table~\ref{tab:records}, Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}).

For all proxy records, we firstly run a low-resolution simulation, using
a~10\,km, 300 by 150~points horizontal grid for SSA and SIA velocities,
up to 51~enthalpy layers in the ice, and 31~temperature layers in the bedrock.
For the GRIP and EPICA records, we then run a second simulation using a higher
horizontal resolution of 6\,km, up to 101~ice layers, and 61~bedrock
layers. In the rest of this paper, we refer to different model runs by the
proxy record used for palaeo-temperature forcing.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite large differences in input temperature offset time-series, the model
output presents consistent features that can be observed across the range of
forcing data used. In all simulations, total ice volume is relatively low
during most of the glacial cycle, while two major glaciation events occur
during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and MIS~2
(29.5--16.9\,kyr, Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}). A local ice minimum is
consistently attained during MIS~3 (52.2--45.6\,kyr). However, the
magnitude and timing of these events depend significantly on the choice of
proxy record used for palaeo-temperature forcing.

Simulations forced by the Greenland ice core records (GRIP, NGRIP) produce
highest variability in modelled ice volume throughout the glaciation history.
Model runs using oceanic and Antarctic records generally result in lower
modelled ice volume during MIS~4 and larger ice volume during MIS~3, thus
suggesting lower ice volume variability throughout the simulation length. The
NGRIP palaeo-temperature forcing is the only one that results in larger
glaciation during MIS~4 than during the last glacial maximum.

While simulations driven by the Antarctic (EPICA, Vostok) and GRIP records
reach a last glacial maximum in ice volume between 19.5 and 16.9\,kyr,
those steered by oceanic (ODP~1012, ODP~1020) and the NGRIP record attain it
several thousands of years earlier. Moreover, the ODP~1012 run yields rapid
deglaciation prior to 20\,kyr due to a local temperature maximum that is
inconsistent with all other records used. The ODP~1020 simulation predicts an
early last glacial maximum in ice volume at 29.5\,kyr, followed by
slower deglaciation than modelled using other records. Finally, model runs
informed by Antarctic ice core records produce a continuous, rapid deglaciation
after the last glacial maximum, whereas the simulations driven by the GRIP
record produce a rapid deglaciation in three steps, including stand-stills and
readvances of the ice margin.

Despite the different timing, snapshots of model output show relatively
consistent patterns of glaciation (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}). As a result of
different scaling factors applied to palaeo-temperature proxy records, the
ice sheet geometry at the last glacial maximum appears very similar from one
simulation to the next. It includes a central divide located at about
3\,500\,m elevation along the spine of the Rocky Mountains. In all
simulations, a central ice cap persists over the Skeena mountains during MIS~3
between the two glaciation events. However, the size of this ice cap, as well
as the magnitude of the MIS~4 glaciation, depends sensitively on the choice of
palaeo-temperature proxy record used to drive the model.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Timing of the glaciation peaks}

Independently of the choice of palaeo-temperature record used as forcing
time-series for the ice sheet model, our simulations consistently produce two
glaciation maxima during MIS~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and MIS~2
(29.5--16.9\,kyr). These events broadly correspond in timing to the
Gladstone (MIS~4) and McConell (MIS~2) glaciations documented by geological
evidence in the northern part of the model domain \aref, and to the Fraser
(MIS~2) glaciation in the southern part \aref.

However, the timing of the modelled glacial maxima strongly depends on the
choice of palaeo-temperature record used, and a more precise agreement with
timing reconstructed from geological evidence is only attained in some of our
simulations. In the Puget lowland, the last glacial maximum advance of the
southern Cordilleran ice sheet margin has been constrained by radiocarbon
dating between 17.4 and 16.4\,\unit{\chem{^{14}C}\,cal\,kyr\,BP}
\citep[Fig.~4]{Porter.Swanson.1998}.
These dates have been confirmed by the offshore sediment record, which shows an
increase of glaciomarine sedimentation between 19.5 and
16.2\,\unit{\chem{^{14}C}\,cal\,kyr\,BP} \citep{Cosma.etal.2008}.

Among simulations presented here, only those forced by the GRIP, EPICA and
Vostok records place the last glacial maximum within this range
(Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}, lower panel). Simulations driven by the NGRIP,
ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 records, on the contrary, produce a last glacial maximum
that pre-dates reconstructed ages by several thousand years. Concerning the
simulations driven by oceanic (ODP~1012, ODP~1020) records, this early
deglaciation is caused by an early warming sealed in the palaeo-temperature records
(Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries}, upper panel). However, it has been shown that this
early warming is a local effect, corresponding to a weakening of the California
current \citep[Fig.~3]{Herbert.etal.2001}. The California current, driving cold
waters southwards
along the western coast of North America, is thought to have weakened in the
presence of the Cordilleran ice sheet, resulting in paradoxically warmer
sea-surface temperatures at the locations of the ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 sites
during the last glacial maximum \citep{Herbert.etal.2001}.

Because most of the Cordilleran ice sheet marine front lies in a different
oceanic circulation gyre than that holding the California current, it is
unlikely that it was affected by this early warming. However, the above paradox
illustrates the complexity of ice-sheet feedbacks on regional climate, and
demonstrates that, although located in the neighbourhood of the modelling
domain, the ODP~1012 and ODP~1020 palaeo-temperature proxy records can not be
used as a realistic forcing time-series to model the Cordilleran ice sheet
through the last glacial cycle.

These results make us believe that a palaeo-temperature proxy record located
in the direct vicinity of the former Cordilleran ice sheet would be of great
help to understand its glacial history. Because, to our knowledge, no such
record yet exists, we focus the rest of our analysis on simulations forced by
temperature records from Greenland (GRIP) and Antarctic (EPICA) ice cores.

\subsection{Spatial imprint of ice cover}

Although snapshots from the model output (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots}) give a
crisp picture of modelled ice dynamics at specific time frames, they often
can not be directly compared to geomorphological evidence, which is by nature
time-transgressive. In this section, we use the 6-km horizontal-resolution
model output from simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA records to produce
a series of time-integrated plots containing information aggregated over the
whole simulation period.

During most of the glacial cycle, modelled ice cover is restricted to disjoint
ice caps centred on major mountain ranges of the North American Cordillera
(Fig.~\ref{fig:duration}). In both simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA
records, a~contiguous ice cover spanning from the Alaska Range to the Rocky
Mountains exists for about 29\,kyr in total over MIS~2 and~4.

With the exception of the oceanic front and the northern foothills of the Alaska
Range, most of the maximal extent of the ice sheet is associated with short
durations of ice cover, generally a few thousand years, distributed over one
(GRIP) or two (EPICA) glaciations. This shows that, in our simulations, the
most extensive stages of the Cordilleran ice sheet are both short-lived and
out of balance with contemporary climate states, which confirms
previous interpretations of the geological record \citep{Clague.etal.1980,
Stroeven.etal.2010}.

However, our simulations depict, independently of the choice of record used for
palaeo-temperature forcing, a central Skeena mountain ice cap persisting
throughout the entire last glacial cycle (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots} and
\ref{fig:duration}). In particular, this ice cap persists between the MIS~4
and MIS~2 glaciations, providing a nucleation centre for the onset of glacial
readvance towards the last glacial maximum.

During time periods when a fully-grown Cordilleran ice sheet is absent from our
simulation, the presence of the Skeena ice cap can be explained by a more
widespread winter precipitation there than in other parts of the modelling
domain (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}). Along most of the north-western North American
shore, coastal mountain ranges provide a sharp orographic barrier to westerly
winds, capturing atmospheric moisture in the form of precipitation, and leaving
interior lowlands arid. However, near the centre of our modelling domain, this
barrier is less pronounced than
elsewhere, allowing westerly winds to carry moisture further inland, until it
is progressively captured by the broad and mildly elevated group of the Skeena
Mountains.

In addition, the erosional landscape of the Skeena mountain bears one of the
strongest glacial imprint (?) found within the area formerly covered by the
Cordilleran ice sheet \aref. Here we suggest that persistent ice cover
associated with basal ice temperatures at the pressure-melting point
(Fig.~\ref{fig:warmbase}) may partly explain this spectacular landscape.

\subsection{Deglaciation history}

In the North American Cordillera alike other glaciated regions, the large
majority of the glacial geologic record relates to the last few millennia of
glacier cover, most of the older evidence having been overridden by ice retreat
retreat during the deglaciation.

In our simulations, the timing of the last glacial maximum, and in turn that of
the deglaciation, depends on the palaeo-temperature time-series used to force
the model (Figs.~\ref{fig:timeseries} and ~\ref{fig:deglacseries}). The
6\,km-resolution simulation forced by the EPICA record reaches a maximal
ice volume at 17.3\,kyr, followed by a continuous deglaciation between
about 17 and 11\,kyr. That driven by the GRIP record reaches maximal
volume at 19.1\,kyr, and produces a deglaciation in three steps,
including the first stand-still between 16.6 and 14.5\,kyr, and a late
glacial re-advance between 12.6 and 11.6\,kyr.

\todo{discuss the work that supports YD re-advance.}

Although the predicted timing of glacier retreat differs, its patterns are
relatively consistent between the two simulations (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}). In
both runs, the southern half of the modelling domain, including the Puget
Lowland, the Coast and Rocky Mountains and the Interior Plateau of British
Columbia, are completely deglaciated by 12\,kyr, whereas significant
ice cover remains on the Skeena, Selwyn, MacKenzie, Wrangell and Saint-Elias Mountains
in the northern half of the domain. At this stage, a late glacial re-advance
occurs in the GRIP simulation. Both simulations then show an unzipping of the
Liard Lowland, followed by ice retreat towards the Selwyn Mountains and the
Skeena Mountains, which host the last remains of the palaeo-ice sheet.

\todo{discuss existing evidence (Martin).}

On the Interior Plateau of British Columbia, modelled deglaciation consists of
a rapid northwards retreat, leaving a slow-flowing ice lobe on the
plateau, while the surrounding mountain ranges are already deglaciated
(Figs.~\ref{fig:profiles-grip} and~\ref{fig:profiles-epica}). Although this
supports the top-down (?)
deglaciation hypothesis for central British Columbia, modelled, southwards,
last flow directions do not agree with the local lineation patterns
(Fig.~\ref{fig:lastflow}). This could indicate that the lineations are older,
or that the modelled last glacial maximum ice sheet is too extensive to the
east, resulting in modelled deglaciation flow patterns different from those
observed in the geomorphology.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\conclusions
\label{sec:concl}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Numerical simulations of the Cordilleran ice sheet through the last glacial
cycle presented in this study consistently produce two glaciation maxima during
MIS~4 (61.9--55.4\,kyr) and MIS~2 (29.5--16.9\,kyr), two periods
corresponding to documented extensive palaeo-glaciations. This result is
independent of the choice of palaeo-temperature record used to approximate the
past evolution of climate forcing, and
can be seen as a first-order agreement between the model and geomorphological
evidence. However, the timing of the two glaciation peaks depends sensitively
on which record
is used to drive the model. The timing of the last glacial maximum is best
reproduced by the Antarctic record, and occurs too early in all simulations
that are driven by other records. The mismatch is greatest when using
oceanic records from the Pacific Northwest, which are affected by the
weakening of the California current during the last glacial maximum.

In all simulations presented here, ice cover is limited to disjoint mountain ice
caps during most of the glacial cycle. This agrees with earlier interpretations
of the geological evidence preceding the last glacial maximum. However, our
simulations produce persistent ice cover over the Skeena mountains during
the entire glacial cycle. At the time when a full-size Cordilleran ice sheet is
absent, the Skeena ice cap appears to be fed by the eastwards precipitation
intrusion through a topographic window in the Coast Mountains. The ice cap acts
as a nucleation centre at the onset of the last glacial maximum re-advance, and
may have contributed to the spectacular glacial imprint of the Skeena Mountains
erosional landscape.

Concerning the deglaciation phase, when most geological evidence is available,
none of the palaeo-temperature records used produces an ideal agreement between
model results and geological evidence. The timing of the last glacial maximum
and early deglaciation is generally best reproduced by forcing the model with
Antarctic records. However, the Younger Dryas re-advance is only reproduced
using temperature forcing from the GRIP record at places where it has been
documented. Nonetheless, the patterns of deglaciation are consistent between
both simulations driven by the GRIP and EPICA record. They show a rapid
deglaciation of the southern half of the ice
sheet, followed by unzipping of the Liard Lowland, and concentric retreat of
the ice margin towards the last palaeo-ice cover in the Skeena Mountains
during the early Holocene (10.9--9.5\,kyr).

One must keep in mind, however, that these results are only accurate for our
choices of ice-sheet model (PISM), surface mass balance model (PDD) and climate
forcing. Most importantly, our simplistic
palaeo-climate forcing does not include precipitation corrections in response
to the presence of an ice cover, likely leading to overestimated glacial
extent and volume. Nevertheless, our results identify that the largely
understudied Skeena Mountains are a key area to understanding glacial dynamics
of the Cordilleran ice sheet, highlighting the need for further geological
investigation of this region.
