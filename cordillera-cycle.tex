% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

  Despite more than a century of geological observations, the Cordilleran ice
  sheet of North America remains poorly understood in terms of its former
  extent, volume and dynamics. Although geomorphological evidence is abundant,
  its complexity is such that whole ice-sheet reconstructions of advance and
  retreat patterns are lacking. Here we use a numerical ice sheet model
  calibrated against field-based evidence to attempt a quantitative
  reconstruction of the Cordilleran ice sheet history through the last glacial
  cycle. A series of simulations is driven by time-dependent temperature
  offsets from six proxy records located around the globe. Although this
  approach reveals large variations in model response to evolving atmospheric
  forcing, all simulations produce two major glaciations events during MIS~4
  (60\,\unit{kyr}) and MIS~2 (20\,\unit{kyr}). The timing of glaciation is
  better reproduced using temperature forcing derived from Greenland and
  Antarctic ice-core than from regional ocean sediment cores. During most of
  the last glacial cycle, the modelled ice cover is discontinuous and
  restricted to high mountain areas. However, widespread precipitation over the
  Skeena mountains favours the persistence of a central ice dome throughout the
  glacial cycle. It acts as a nucleation centre before the last glacial maximum
  (35\,\unit{kyr}) and hosts the last remain of Cordilleran ice during the
  early Holocene (8\,\unit{kyr}).

\introduction
\label{sec:intro}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cordilleran ice sheet has a long history of explorations and geological
investigations. However, the complexity of the evidence is such that no ice-
sheet scale reconstructions are yet possible. Here we use numerical modelling,
calibrated with field evidence to attempt such a reconstruction.

Fig.~\ref{fig:locmap} about here.

\section{Model setup}
\label{sec:model}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Ice thermodynamics}

SSA+SIA, pseudo-plastic sliding, temperature-dependent flow.

\subsection{Bedrock response}

Thermal model and deformation model.

\subsection{Surface mass balance}

Positive degree-day model including spatially and seasonally variable standard
deviation (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}).

\subsection{Atmospheric forcing}

Input climatology from North American Regional Reanalysis according to
sensitivity study from the previous paper (Fig.~\ref{fig:atm}).

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Palaeo-climate sensitivity test}

All six simulations consistently produce two major glaciations during MIS~4 and
MIS~2 (Figs.~\ref{fig:timeseries} and~\ref{fig:multirec}).
However the timing is much different. Notably the oceanic core forcing result
in much too early last glacial maximum.

\subsection{High-resolution simulations}

We re-run the GRIP (?) and Vostok (?) core simulations at higher resolution
(Figs.~\ref{fig:hires-timeseries} and ~\ref{fig:hires-snapshots}). Results are
consistent with lower resolution but differences appear due to small-scale
topography better capturing mass-balance lapse-rate effects. In general the
Greenland-based simulation show much more variability.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Timing of glaciation}

Timing of glaciation is better reproduced by Greenland and Antarctic cores than
nearby oceanic records. This is because the oceanic cores are affected by
variations in strength of a local current (the California current) associated
with the presence of the ice sheet. The timing of the LGM is better reproduced
by Antarctic than Greenland records.

\subsection{Extent of glaciation}

During most of the glacial cycle, ice cover is restricted to high mountain
areas. This is particularly true when using the Greenland-based forcing
(Fig~\ref{fig:duration}). Most of the glacial maxima margin have a transient
character, showing that the ice sheet is far out of balance with climate. There
persist a central ice dome over the Skeena mountains over the entire glacial
period. This ice dome serves as a nucleation centre at the initiation of the
advance phase preceding the last glacial maximum. It is here because of more
widespread precipitation over the Skeena mountains than across other East-West
transects towards south or north of this region. We interpret this as an
orographic precipitation effect resulting from a "window" through the sharp
range of the Coast Mountains at this latitude (Fig?).

\subsection{Deglaciation patterns}

Deglaciation happens first in the southern half and then in the northern half
of the ice-covered area (Fig.~\ref{fig:deglac}). Retreat patterns are different
than reconstructed over central BC, however they match Martin's reconstruction
of Liard lowland "unzipping" pretty well. In the GRIP-driven simulation, the
patterns of de-glaciation and Younger Dryas re-advance match with recent
cosmogenic exposure dates.
