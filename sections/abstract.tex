\begin{abstract}
We present an ensemble of numerical simulations of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum performed with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, using temperature offsets from present-day climatologies from five different datasets. Monthly mean surface air temperature and monthly precipitation from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, the ERA-Interim reanalysis and the North American Regional Reanalysis are used to compute surface mass balance using a positive degree-day model. Modelled ice sheet outlines and volumes appear highly sensitive to the choice of climate forcing. Best results were obtained using the North American Regional Reanalysis, a high-resolution regional climate reanalysis.
