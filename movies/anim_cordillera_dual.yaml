Abstract:
   During the last glacial cycle, local ice caps from the mountain ranges of the North American Cordillera eventually coalesced to form an ice mass the size of Greenland, the Cordilleran ice sheet. Because of the irregular arrangement of valleys and ridges that forms the ice sheet’s floor, ice moved along tortuous and intertwined pathways, sometimes following the major topographical troughs, and sometimes flowing across them. The complexity of regional climate adds to the complexity of topography. Strong differences in seasonality and timing of precipitation exist, for instance, between the rain-drenched coastal areas, and the dry interior (https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-8-1087-2014).

   The animation uses a computer model that contains knowledge on glacier physics based on modern observations of Greenland and Antarctica and laboratory experiments on ice, and was calibrated with help from traces left by glaciers on the landscape, and ran one of the fastest computers in the world. It is an attempt to reconstruct the multiple phases of advance and retreat of the former Cordilleran ice sheet from 120000 years ago to today. Two different climate scenarios are presented, none of them fully capturing the complexity of geologic evidence left by ice in the Cordillera (https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-639-2016).
